# MATE ROV Technical Reports - 2019

In order from my most to least favorite. I didn't use the rubric or anything, just judging on preference. 

## [HKUST - EPOXSEA](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/HKUST_EPOXSEA_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This team got 1st place.
```diff
+Really well designed
+Use of tranparency in images is really professional
+Lots of decision diagrams make it clear why they did what they did
+Contains diagrams of different levels of abstraction, which makes the design clear
+Great writing & specific vocab use. It feels like these could have been written by PhD's in each subject covered.
-Some of the diagrams are too small, and their text wouldn't be printable.
@@Opinion: This won the competition, and it's clear why.@@
```

## [Jesuit High School - Jesuit Robotics](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/JesuitHighSchool_Rovotics_Technical_Report_2019.pdf)
This team got 3rd place overall, and best technical documentation. They have a really nice GUI design.
```diff
+Well designed, looks very professional
+Names, like the robot name, are italicized, which makes things way clearer.
-The electrical diagrams are neat looking, but I can't understand half of the information because they're so cluttered
@@Opinion: This is really well done, and looks incredibly professional.@@
```

## [City Univ of Hong Kong - CityU Underwater Robotics](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/City%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong_CityU%20Underwater%20Robotics_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This team got 5th place.
```diff
+Good analysis, clearly knew what they were doing
+Nice document design
+Writing is technical, nothing that the report would be better without
+Clear diagrams that actually make sense
@@Opinion: Really good. It's easy to get what their robot is made up of and how it was meant to work from the start.@@
```

## [Case Western Univ - CWRUbotix](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/CWRU_CWRUbotix_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This was the third best technical document. The team got 6th place overall.
```diff
+Well organized
+Lots of info, no needlessly long space-filling
+Does not feel like this document was an afterthought
-Figures are all bad. Some are too pixelated to even possibly read the text, and some are too small.
-Diagrams are largely unclear.
@@Opinion: This is a good document overall, the only real problem I had was with visual/written clarity.@@
```

## [AASTMT - Invictus](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/AASTMT_Invictus_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This team got 2nd place.
```diff
+Well written, clearly knew their audience.
+Well-chosen images
+Good diagrams
+Standard, clear software diagrams
-Electrical diagrams are undreadable and have no directional dataflow
@@Opinion: Good writing, although some of it feels like last-minute space filling.@@
```

## [Purdue University - Purdue IEE ROV Team](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/Purdue%20University_Proven%20Robotics_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This got the second highest score for technical documentation. I think that was mainly on rubric technicality, since the rest of the scores were bad.
```diff
+Clearly organized
-Horrid desgn, I actually got a headache reading this
-Lots of paragraphs are clearly just sentences they extended to get the page count.
@@Opinion: This is hard to read and generally bad, but I guess it met all the rubric requirements, because it got a great score.@@
```

## [Copiah-Lincoln - SeaWolves](https://files.materovcompetition.org/TechReportArchives/2019/Copiah-Lincoln_Seawolves_Technical%20Documentation_2019.pdf)
This team got 12th place.
```diff
+Writing is mostly good
-Used a lot of images they just got off the internet, no credits or anything
-Font bad, formatting worse.
-At least they tried to use standard diagrams?
-Lots of images are way too small to see details. Especially Figure 15
-Sideways diagrams that could have been vertical.
@@Opinion: Lots of this is unclear or just gives information that isn't actually significant to the system operation.@@
```
